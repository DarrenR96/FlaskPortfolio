    Hi! My name is Darren Ramsook & I‚Äôm a PhD Candidate at Trinity College Dublin (under the Sigmedia Group), working on a combination of Video Codecs and Machine Learning. I have a with a keen interest in image/video and audio signal processing. This interest in Audio/Image processing is mainly due to the arts having a special place in my heart & also because I‚Äôm an avid musician. 
    I have my MSc. Data Science & BSc. Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of the West Indies. I combine my love for signal processing, software engineering and data science to help systems better analyze the world around us.

    title: Instant Message Summarization with Emoji Unicode Characterset Support
    subtitle: Abstractive Susmmarization of Instant Messages
    description: Research into two models for summarizing an instant message, through the use of text and the Emoji Unicode Characterset, for applications where screen space is limited (eg smartwatches). The first proposed model utilizes a Greedy N-gram token replacement method, while the second proposed model utilizes a Transformer network. The Transformer network was trained on a set of 532 manually labelled instant messages and 92554 automatically labelled dialogue sentences. Initial results showed the Greedy N-gram token replacement method produced higher quality results and this method was evluated using human participants. It was found that there is an increase in average time taken to read and interpret the summarized messages when compared to the unsummarized messages.

    title: Web Server Instrusion Detection and Avoidance
    subtitle: Trained A.I. Based System for Web Server Instrusion Detection and Avoidance
    description: This program utilizes the combined access log format of apache web servers to extract certain key features of actions and classifies users in one of three possible groups (Malicious, Unknown & Safe). This system allows for a headless operation once deployed. The system automatically performs pre-processing, classification and populates a list of Internet Protocol addresses whose access to the web server is prohibited. This system was made open source for both public use and development. This trained model resulted in an accuracy score of 94.5% on the test set.

    subtitle: Optimal Impression Calculator for Multi-Stage Advertisement Campaigns on Social Media
    description: This calculator was built based on the assumption that within a given Social Network, friends of a given person has an effect on the probability of that person clicking an advertisement. This calculator evaluates a scenario where advertisements are split up between two stages, with the second stage being affected by what has occured in the first stage. For more information about this check out this paper - On the Problem of Multi-Staged Impression Allocation in Online Social Networks, done by Inzamam Rahaman and Patrick Hosein.
